## Clarifications

I have not completed all the 5 steps because it seemed like it took me longer to fulfill the tasks for various reasons, also I paused during development because I was not sure about some specification, emailed it as a query then came back to development later in the day

1. I thought initially that I only needed to develop a library and test it, not a program to add input to it? later on I added a console app with some hard coded values to print an order summary, not sure whether I was supposed to allow user to provide input

2. I started with using *int* as type for parcel properties but whilst working I changed it to *double* because I felt like more precision might be wanted? in nature nothing really comes in rounded numbers

3. I was not sure about the requirement that *the cheapest option should always be returned*, did that mean that for a medium parcel weighting 30kgs it should be categorized as a heavy parcel because that would make it cheaper, or something similar?
